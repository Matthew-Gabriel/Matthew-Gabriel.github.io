### Favorite Labs of CPSC 120L

* Lab-4 part-2
Lab 4 part 2 was the HiLo game. The reason that I liked this lab was because it was the first game that we made in C++. In addition to this, Games are what got me into computer science in the first place. We also learned to use cin, taking user input and integrating it as part of the game by using if statements to make the game.


* Lab 6 both parts



* Lab 7 part-1
