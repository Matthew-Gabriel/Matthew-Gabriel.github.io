### Favorite Labs of CPSC 120L

* Lab-4 part-2

Lab 4 part 2 was the HiLo game. The reason that I liked this lab was because it was the first game that we made in C++. In addition to this, Games are what got me into computer science in the first place. We also learned to use cin, taking user input and integrating it as part of the game by using if statements to make the game.


* Lab 6 both parts

Lab 6 had two parts, the build a sandwich activity and black jack game calculator. For the first part, I liked the build a sandwich activity because it was plain silly, making a program for a sandwich, you could put anything in there because there were no checks to see if it was actually edible, which was funny to me. In this lab, we learned to grab inputs from the command line and use them for our own purposes, in this case it was to form a sandwich. For the second part, I always liked card games, and black jack is a classic one, although we did not make an actual functioning black jack game, we did make the calculator for it, which was interesting. In this part of the lab, we learned using functions, by using multiple functions and calling them in order to calculate the true value of a given hand.


* Lab 7 part-1

Lab 7 part-1 was actually the only part of lab 7. The reason I liked this lab so much was because I found it really neat to use our programming skills in order to make a program that might serve some actual everyday use, also the signs were pretty neat. What we ended up learning here was the use of combining our previous skills of command line, If statements, Functions and combining them all together in order to make a cohesive program.
